#ESSENTIAL OVERVIEW:
# After the network is trained, the entire lung scans could
# be used as input to obtain all suspicious nodules. Because
# the network is fully convolutional, it is straightforward to do
# this. But it is infeasible with our GPU memory constraint.
# Even though the network needs much fewer memory in testing
# than in training, the requirement still exceeds the maximum
# memory of the GPU. To overcome this problem, we split the
# lung scans into several parts (208 x 208 x 208 x 1 per part),
# process them separately, and then combine the results. We
# keep these splits overlapped by a large margin (32 pixels)
# to eliminate the unwanted border effects during convolution
# computations.
